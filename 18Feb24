# Question-1) https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-set-discard-remove-pop/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Task
# You have a non-empty set , and you have to execute  commands given in  lines.

# The commands will be pop, remove and discard.

# Input Format

# The first line contains integer , the number of elements in the set .
# The second line contains  space separated elements of set . All of the elements are non-negative integers, less than or equal to 9.
# The third line contains integer , the number of commands.
# The next  lines contains either pop, remove and/or discard commands followed by their associated value.

# Constraints

# Output Format

# Print the sum of the elements of set  on a single line.

# Solution:
# n = int(input())
# s = set(map(int, input().split()))
# N=int(input())
# for i in range(N):
#     cmd=list(map(str,input().split()))
#     if cmd[0] == "pop":
#         s.pop()
#     elif cmd[0]=="remove":
#         try:
#             s.remove(int(cmd[1]))
#         except:
#             continue
#     elif cmd[0] =="discard":
#         try:
#             s.discard(int(cmd[1]))
#         except:
#             continue
        
# print(sum(s))

# Question-2) https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-collections-deque/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Task

# Perform append, pop, popleft and appendleft methods on an empty deque .

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer , the number of operations.
# The next  lines contains the space separated names of methods and their values.

# Constraints


# Output Format

# Print the space separated elements of deque .

# Solution:
# # Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# from collections import deque

# D = deque()

# for _ in range(int(input())):
#     oper,val,*args=input().split() + ['']
#     eval(f'D.{oper} ({val})')
# print(*D)
