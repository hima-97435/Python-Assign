# Task
# You are given two values  and .
# Perform integer division and print .
# Input Format
# The first line contains , the number of test cases.
# The next  lines each contain the space separated values of  and .
# Constraints
# Output Format
# Print the value of .
# In the case of ZeroDivisionError or ValueError, print the error code

# Solution:
# # Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# for i in range(int(input())):
#     try:
#         a,b=map(int,input().split())
#         print(a//b)
#     except Exception as e:
#         print("Error Code:",e)

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer , the total number of students.
# The second line contains the names of the columns in any order.
# The next  lines contains the , ,  and , under their respective column names.

# Constraints


# Output Format

# Print the average marks of the list corrected to 2 decimal places.

# Solution:
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# import collections

# n = int(input())
# scol = ','.join(input().split())
# Student = collections.namedtuple('Student',scol)

# sum = 0
# for i in range(n):
#     row = input().split()
#     student = Student(*row)
#     sum += int(student.MARKS)

# print(sum/n)
