# Question-1) https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/triangle-quest-2/problem?isFullScreen=true
# You are given a positive integer .
# Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size .

# For example, a palindromic triangle of size  is:

# 1
# 121
# 12321
# 1234321
# 123454321
# You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you.
# You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

# Note:
# Using anything related to strings will give a score of .
# Using more than one for-statement will give a score of .

# Input Format

# A single line of input containing the integer .

# Constraints

# Output Format

# Print the palindromic triangle of size  as explained above.
# Solution:

# for i in range(1,int(input())+1): #More than 2 lines will result in 0 score. Do not leave a blank line also
#     print(((10**i)//9)**2)

# Question-2) :https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/iterables-and-iterators/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Input Format
# The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the integer , denoting the length of the list. The next line consists of  space-separated lowercase English letters, denoting the elements of the list.
# The third and the last line of input contains the integer , denoting the number of indices to be selected.
# Output Format
# Output a single line consisting of the probability that at least one of the  indices selected contains the letter:''.

# Solution:
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# from itertools import combinations
# N = int(input())
# L = input().split()
# K = int(input())
# C = list(combinations(L, K))
# F = filter(lambda c: 'a' in c, C)
# print('{0:.3}'.format(len(list(F))/len(C)))
