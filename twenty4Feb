# Task
# Students of District College have a subscription to English and French newspapers. Some students have subscribed to only the English newspaper, some have subscribed to only the French newspaper, and some have subscribed to both newspapers.

# You are given two sets of student roll numbers. One set has subscribed to the English newspaper, and one set has subscribed to the French newspaper. Your task is to find the total number of students who have subscribed to only English newspapers.

# Input Format

# The first line contains the number of students who have subscribed to the English newspaper.
# The second line contains the space separated list of student roll numbers who have subscribed to the English newspaper.
# The third line contains the number of students who have subscribed to the French newspaper.
# The fourth line contains the space separated list of student roll numbers who have subscribed to the French newspaper.

# Constraints


# Output Format

# Output the total number of students who are subscribed to the English newspaper only.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# _ = int(input())
# SET_N = set(map(int, input().split()))
# _ = int(input())
# SET_B = set(map(int, input().split()))
# print(len(SET_N.difference(SET_B)))

# Question-2) https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-integers-come-in-all-sizes/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is:  (c++ int) or  (C++ long long int).
# As we know, the result of  grows really fast with increasing .
# Let's do some calculations on very large integers.
# Task
# Read four numbers, , , , and , and print the result of .
# Input Format
# Integers , , , and  are given on four separate lines, respectively.
# Constraints
# Output Format
# Print the result of  on one line.

# Solution:
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# a=int(input())
# b=int(input())
# c=int(input())
# d=int(input())

# print((a**b)+(c**d))
