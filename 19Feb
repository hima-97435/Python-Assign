# HAckerRAnk Problem:

# Question-1) https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compress-the-string/problem?isFullScreen=true

# You are given a string . Suppose a character '' occurs consecutively  times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character '' with  in the string.

# For a better understanding of the problem, check the explanation.

# Input Format

# A single line of input consisting of the string .

# Output Format

# A single line of output consisting of the modified string.

# Solution:
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# from itertools import groupby

# # using for loop to iterate through the string
# for k, c in groupby(input()):
        
#     #printing the output
#     print("(%d, %d)" % (len(list(c)), int(k)), end=' ')

# Question-2)  https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/most-commons/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Input Format

# A single line of input containing the string .

# Constraints

#  has at least  distinct characters
# Output Format

# Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count each on a separate line.
# Sort output in descending order of occurrence count.
# If the occurrence count is the same, sort the characters in alphabetical order.

# Solution:

# import sys
# from collections import Counter



# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     s = input()
#     s=sorted(s)
    
#     FREQUENCY = Counter(list(s))
    
#     for k , v in FREQUENCY.most_common(3):
#         print(k,v)
