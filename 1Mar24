# Question-1) https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-eval/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Task
# You are given an expression in a line. Read that line as a string variable, such as var, and print the result using eval(var).

# NOTE: Python2 users, please import from __future__ import print_function.

# Constraint
# Input string is less than 100 characters.

# Solution:
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# from __future__ import print_function
# eval(input())

# Question-2) https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-sort-sort/problem?isFullScreen=true

# Note: If two attributes are the same for different rows, for example, if two atheletes are of the same age, print the row that appeared first in the input.

# Input Format

# The first line contains  and  separated by a space.
# The next  lines each contain  elements.
# The last line contains .

# Constraints
# Each element 

# Output Format

# Print the  lines of the sorted table. Each line should contain the space separated elements. Check the sample below for clarity.

# Solution:
#!/bin/python3

# import math
# import os
# import random
# import re
# import sys



# N, M = map(int, input().split())
# rows = [input() for _ in range(N)]
# K = int(input())
# for row in sorted(rows, key=lambda row: int(row.split()[K])):
#     print(row)
